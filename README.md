# COMP 2137 F25 - Linux Automation Portfolio

This repository serves as a portfolio of my work for the **COMP 2137 - Linux Automation** course. This course focuses on developing essential administrative scripting and system automation skills within a Linux environment.

The projects within showcase my ability to leverage the command line and various configuration management tools to streamline complex IT operations, preparing me for a career in Systems Administration or DevOps.

## ðŸ‘· Repository Structure (Under Construction)

This section outlines the planned organization for my course work. **This repository is currently being set up, and the folders below will be populated soon** as assignments are completed and lab materials are organized.

| Directory | Purpose | Examples of Content |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`/Assignments`** | Final, graded project submissions that combine multiple skills to solve complex, real-world automation challenges. | System health report scripts, user environment management tools, automated deployment formulas. |
| **`/Labs`** | Ungraded, foundational exercises and proof-of-concept code used for building initial proficiency in new commands and scripting concepts. | Command-line review exercises, conditional logic (if/else) scripts, regular expression practices. |
| **`/Resources`** | Personal documentation, custom functions, command quick-references, or study guides created during the course. | Bash function library, Ansible playbook templates. |
